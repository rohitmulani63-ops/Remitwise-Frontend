# RemitWise Frontend

Frontend application for the RemitWise remittance and financial planning platform.

> **New contributors:** start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for branch conventions, verified test commands, and PR expectations, then read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for a full route and layer map.

## Overview

This is a Next.js-based frontend skeleton that provides the UI structure for all RemitWise features. The application is built with:

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

## Features (Placeholders)

The frontend includes placeholder pages and components for:

1. **Dashboard** - Overview of remittances, savings, bills, and insurance
2. **Send Money** - Remittance sending interface with automatic split preview
3. **Smart Money Split** - Configuration for automatic allocation
4. **Savings Goals** - Goal-based savings tracking and management
5. **Bill Payments** - Bill tracking, scheduling, and payment
6. **Micro-Insurance** - Policy management and premium payments
7. **Family Wallets** - Family member management with roles and spending limits

## Loading States

Dashboard, Bills, and Insights now use route-level skeleton screens built from `components/ui/Skeleton.tsx` so primary panels load with stable layout blocks instead of ad-hoc spinners.

## Getting Started

### Environment Configuration

The application requires connection to a Soroban RPC node.

- **Testnet:** `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` (Passphrase: `Test SDF Network ; September 2015`)
- **Mainnet:** `https://soroban-rpc.stellar.org` (Passphrase: `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015`)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup Database
# 1. Ensure you have `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"`
# Note: For serverless environments (like Vercel), connection pooling limits (default min 1, max 10) 
# and timeouts (5s) are automatically configured on the Prisma DB client.
# 2. Run initial Prisma migration
npx prisma migrate dev

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Testing

The project includes unit tests and integration tests for API routes.

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
npm test

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# Run integration tests in watch mode
npm run test:integration:watch
```

#### Unit Tests

- **Location**: `tests/unit/`
- **Command**: `npm run test:unit`
- **Framework**: Node.js built-in `test` module

#### Integration Tests

- **Location**: `tests/integration/`
- **Command**: `npm run test:integration`
- **Framework**: Node.js `node:test` + direct route handler calls
- **Database**: In-memory SQLite (fast, isolated)
- **Speed**: Sub-10 second execution

**What's Tested:**

- `GET /api/health` - Health check (no auth required)
- `POST /api/auth/nonce` - Nonce generation
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authentication with signature
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Session cleanup
- `GET /api/split` - Protected route with auth enforcement
- Error handling (400, 401, 404 responses)

**How They Work:**
Integration tests import route handlers directly and call them as functions with mock requests. No server startup overhead, fully deterministic.

**Documentation**: See [docs/TESTING_INTEGRATION.md](docs/TESTING_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed guide on writing and running integration tests.

#### CI Integration

Tests run on GitHub Actions for every push/PR to `main` and `dev`. The pipeline fails if any tests fail.

### Authentication & Signature Verification

RemitWise implements a nonce-based challenge-response authentication mechanism to verify genuine wallet ownership over the Stellar network.

**Message Format and Verification Steps:**

1. **Request Nonce:** The frontend calls `GET /api/auth/nonce?address=<STELLAR_PUBLIC_KEY>` to receive a securely generated random 32-byte hex string (nonce). This nonce is temporarily cached on the server.
2. **Sign Nonce:** The client wallet (e.g., Freighter) is prompted to sign the raw nonce. The message to be signed is the byte representation of the hex nonce.
3. **Submit Signature:** The client submits `{"address": "...", "signature": "..."}` to `POST /api/auth/login`. The signature should be base64-encoded.
4. **Verification:** The backend converts the nonce to a Buffer and verifies the base64 signature against the supplied public address using `@stellar/stellar-sdk` (`Keypair.fromPublicKey(address).verify(nonceBuffer, signatureBuffer)`). Invalid signatures or missing/expired nonces will receive a `401 Unauthorized`.

### End-to-End Testing

To run the Playwright end-to-end tests for authentication and protected routes:

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## API Routes

See [API Routes Documentation](./docs/API_ROUTES.md) for details on authentication and available endpoints.

**Quick Reference:**

- Public routes: `/api/health`, `/api/auth/*`
- Protected routes: `/api/user/*`, `/api/split`, `/api/goals`, `/api/bills`, `/api/insurance`, `/api/family`, `/api/send`

## Integration Requirements

### Stellar SDK Integration

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Integrate Freighter wallet or similar
   - Connect to Stellar network (testnet/mainnet)
   - Handle account authentication

2. **Smart Contract Integration**
   - Connect to deployed Soroban contracts
   - Implement contract function calls
   - Handle transaction signing and submission

3. **Anchor Platform Integration**
   - Integrate with anchor platform APIs for fiat on/off-ramps
   - Handle deposit/withdrawal flows
   - Process exchange rate quotes
   - **Environment Setup:** Set `ANCHOR_API_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file (see `.env.example`).
   - **Frontend API Endpoints:**
     - `GET /api/anchor/rates` (cached exchange rates)
     - `POST /api/anchor/deposit` (authenticated; starts fiat -> USDC flow)
     - `POST /api/anchor/withdraw` (authenticated; starts USDC -> fiat flow)
   - Deposit/withdraw returns `501 Not Implemented` when anchor integration is not configured.

4. **Transaction Tracking**
   - Display on-chain transaction history
   - Show transaction status and confirmations
   - Implement real-time updates

### Key Integration Points

- **Send Money Page**: Connect to Stellar SDK for transaction creation and signing
- **Split Configuration**: Call `remittance_split` contract to initialize/update split
- **Savings Goals**: Integrate with `savings_goals` contract for goal management
- **Bills**: Connect to `bill_payments` contract for bill tracking
- **Insurance**: Integrate with `insurance` contract for policy management
- **Family Wallets**: Connect to `family_wallet` contract for member management

## Backend / API

### Overview

This Next.js application uses API routes to handle backend functionality. API routes are located in the `app/api/` directory and follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions.

**Key API Routes:**

- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints (wallet connect, nonce generation, signature verification)
- `/api/transactions/*` - Transaction history and status
- `/api/contracts/*` - Soroban smart contract interactions
- `/api/health` - Health check endpoint

All API routes are serverless functions deployed alongside the frontend.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Stellar Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet  # or 'mainnet'
SOROBAN_NETWORK=testnet              # server-side network selector: testnet|mainnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org

# Contract IDs (server-side network resolution)
# Option A: set per-network vars
REMITTANCE_SPLIT_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET=
REMITTANCE_SPLIT_CONTRACT_ID_MAINNET=
SAVINGS_GOALS_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET=
SAVINGS_GOALS_CONTRACT_ID_MAINNET=
BILL_PAYMENTS_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET=
BILL_PAYMENTS_CONTRACT_ID_MAINNET=
INSURANCE_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET=
INSURANCE_CONTRACT_ID_MAINNET=

# Option B: single JSON with network keys
# CONTRACT_IDS_JSON={"testnet":{"REMITTANCE_SPLIT_CONTRACT_ID":"...","SAVINGS_GOALS_CONTRACT_ID":"...","BILL_PAYMENTS_CONTRACT_ID":"...","INSURANCE_CONTRACT_ID":"..."},"mainnet":{"REMITTANCE_SPLIT_CONTRACT_ID":"...","SAVINGS_GOALS_CONTRACT_ID":"...","BILL_PAYMENTS_CONTRACT_ID":"...","INSURANCE_CONTRACT_ID":"..."}}

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
SESSION_COOKIE_NAME=remitwise-session
SESSION_MAX_AGE=86400  # 24 hours in seconds

# API Configuration
API_RATE_LIMIT=100  # requests per minute
API_TIMEOUT=30000  # milliseconds

# Optional: Anchor Platform
ANCHOR_API_BASE_URL=
ANCHOR_API_KEY=
ANCHOR_DEPOSIT_PATH=/transactions/deposit/interactive
ANCHOR_WITHDRAW_PATH=/transactions/withdraw/interactive
ANCHOR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

# Admin / internal APIs
ADMIN_SECRET=

# In-process background shutdown timeout
SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS=15000
```

See `.env.example` for a complete list of configuration options.

### API Middleware Configuration

The middleware (`middleware.ts`) applies CORS headers, security headers, and request validation to all `/api` routes.

#### CORS Policy

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to allow requests from the frontend application:

- **Allowed Origins**: Requests from `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` are allowed (or same-origin)
- **Allowed Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
- **Allowed Headers**: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With
- **Credentials**: Allowed for same-origin requests
- **Preflight Handling**: OPTIONS requests return 204 No Content with appropriate CORS headers

**Configuration:**

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Frontend URL for CORS policy (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Example: Testing CORS**

```bash
# Test CORS headers on a preflight request
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3000/api/health \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST"

# Response includes:
# Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
# Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
# Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With
```

#### Security Headers

All API responses include the following security headers to protect against common vulnerabilities:

| Header                   | Value           | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff`       | Prevents MIME-type sniffing attacks            |
| `X-Frame-Options`        | `DENY`          | Prevents clickjacking attacks                  |
| `X-XSS-Protection`       | `1; mode=block` | Legacy XSS protection (modern browsers ignore) |
| `Vary`                   | `Origin`        | Instructs caches to vary response by origin    |

These headers are applied automatically to all `/api` responses and do not require configuration.

#### Request Body Size Limit

POST, PUT, and PATCH requests are validated for size to prevent oversized payloads:

- **Default Limit**: 1MB (1,048,576 bytes)
- **Validation**: Checks `Content-Length` header first, falls back to reading body if header missing
- **Response**: 413 Payload Too Large with JSON error details if exceeded

**Configuration:**

```bash
# Maximum request body size in bytes (default 1MB)
API_MAX_BODY_SIZE=1048576
```

**Example: Testing Body Size Validation**

```bash
# Valid request (under 1MB)
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":"test"}'
# Response: 200 OK or appropriate handler response

# Oversized request (over 1MB)
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=2 2>/dev/null | base64)"
# Response: 413 Payload Too Large
# {"error": "Payload Too Large", "message": "Request body exceeds maximum size of 1048576 bytes."}
```

#### Middleware Flow

The middleware processes requests in the following order:

1. **Whitelist Checks** - Health check and Playwright test requests bypass all middleware
2. **CORS & Security Headers** - Applied to all responses before processing
3. **Preflight Handling** - OPTIONS requests return 204 No Content
4. **Body Size Validation** - POST/PUT/PATCH requests checked against size limit
5. **Rate Limiting** - Applied after headers/validation (does not block preflight)
6. **Response** - Headers added to response, request proceeds to handler

This order ensures OPTIONS preflight requests complete successfully while maintaining security and rate limiting enforcement.

### Running the Backend

The backend API routes run automatically with the Next.js development server:

```bash
# Development mode (with hot reload)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api/*`

### Authentication Flow

RemitWise uses wallet-based authentication with the following flow:

1. **Wallet Connect**: User connects their Stellar wallet (Freighter, Albedo, etc.)
   - Frontend detects wallet extension
   - User authorizes connection
   - Public key is retrieved

2. **Nonce Generation**:
   - Client requests nonce from `/api/auth/nonce`
   - Server generates unique nonce and stores temporarily
   - Nonce returned to client

3. **Signature Verification**:
   - Client signs nonce with wallet private key
   - Signed message sent to `/api/auth/verify`
   - Server verifies signature matches public key
   - If valid, session token is created

4. **Session Management**:
   - JWT token stored in HTTP-only cookie
   - Token includes user's public key and expiration
   - Subsequent requests include token for authentication
   - Token validated on protected API routes

**Protected Routes**: All `/api/transactions/*`, `/api/contracts/*` endpoints require valid session.

### Contract IDs and Deployment

The application interacts with the following Soroban smart contracts on Stellar:

| Contract         | Purpose                       | Preferred Environment Variable                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Remittance Split | Automatic money allocation    | `REMITTANCE_SPLIT_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET/_MAINNET` |
| Savings Goals    | Goal-based savings management | `SAVINGS_GOALS_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET/_MAINNET`    |
| Bill Payments    | Bill tracking and payments    | `BILL_PAYMENTS_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET/_MAINNET`    |
| Insurance        | Micro-insurance policies      | `INSURANCE_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET/_MAINNET`        |
| Family Wallet    | Family member management      | `FAMILY_WALLET_CONTRACT_ID_TESTNET/_MAINNET`    |

**Deployment Notes:**

- Contracts must be deployed to Stellar testnet/mainnet before use
- Set `SOROBAN_NETWORK=testnet|mainnet` to choose active deployment
- Provide contract IDs per network or via `CONTRACT_IDS_JSON`
- `/api/health` includes current network and resolved contract IDs outside production (or when `HEALTH_INCLUDE_CONTRACT_IDS=true`)
- Contract ABIs are included in `lib/contracts/` directory

### Health and Monitoring

**Health Check Endpoint**: `GET /api/health`

Returns system status and connectivity:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-02-24T10:30:00Z",
  "services": {
    "stellar": "connected",
    "contracts": "available",
    "database": "connected"
  },
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

**Monitoring Recommendations:**

- Set up uptime monitoring for `/api/health`
- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Track Stellar network connectivity
- Log contract interaction failures
- Set alerts for authentication failures

### Testing

**Unit Tests**

Test individual API route handlers and utility functions:

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

Unit tests are located alongside source files with `.test.ts` extension.

**Integration Tests**

Test complete API flows including authentication and contract interactions:

```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Test specific API route
npm run test:integration -- auth
```

Integration tests are in the `__tests__/integration/` directory.

**Testing Checklist:**

- ✓ Authentication flow (nonce → sign → verify)
- ✓ Contract interactions (all 5 contracts)
- ✓ Error handling and validation
- ✓ Rate limiting
- ✓ Session management

### API Documentation

For detailed API specifications:

- **OpenAPI Spec**: See `openapi.yaml` for complete API documentation
- **Anchor/Admin/Shutdown Notes**: See `docs/ANCHOR_ADMIN_SHUTDOWN.md`
- **Interactive Docs**: Run `npm run docs` to view Swagger UI at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`
- **Postman Collection**: Import `postman_collection.json` for testing

**Quick API Reference:**

```bash
# Authentication
POST /api/auth/nonce          # Get nonce for signing
POST /api/auth/verify         # Verify signature and create session
POST /api/auth/logout         # End session

# Transactions
GET  /api/transactions        # List user transactions
GET  /api/transactions/:id    # Get transaction details

# Contracts
POST /api/contracts/split     # Initialize/update split configuration
POST /api/contracts/goals     # Create/manage savings goals
POST /api/contracts/bills     # Manage bill payments
POST /api/contracts/insurance # Manage insurance policies
POST /api/contracts/family    # Manage family wallet

# System
GET  /api/health              # Health check
POST /api/anchor/deposit      # Start anchor deposit flow
POST /api/anchor/withdraw     # Start anchor withdrawal flow
POST /api/admin/cache/clear   # Admin-only cache invalidation
GET  /api/admin/users         # Admin-only recent users
GET  /api/admin/audit         # Admin-only audit events
```

### Anchor deposit/withdraw flow notes

- `POST /api/anchor/deposit` body: `{ "amount": 100, "currency": "USD", "destination": "optional" }`
- `POST /api/anchor/withdraw` body: `{ "amount": 100, "currency": "USD", "destinationAccount": "optional" }`
- Routes call configured anchor interactive endpoints and return either `url` (interactive flow) and/or `steps`.
- Pending flows are stored in-memory so webhook callbacks can reconcile status updates.

### Admin route security

- All `/api/admin/*` routes require `ADMIN_SECRET`.
- Authorized inputs:
  - Header: `X-Admin-Key: <ADMIN_SECRET>`
  - Cookie: `admin_key=<ADMIN_SECRET>` (or `admin_secret=<ADMIN_SECRET>`)
- Rotate `ADMIN_SECRET` regularly; optionally restrict admin routes with an upstream IP allowlist.

### Graceful shutdown for in-process jobs

- In-process background work (nonce cache sweeper and webhook async handlers) now registers `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` handlers.
- On shutdown:
  - New background jobs are rejected.
  - Active jobs are awaited up to `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `15000` ms).
  - Process exits after hooks and timeout race complete.
- If production jobs run externally (Vercel Cron or a separate worker), this in-process shutdown path can remain idle.

## Design Notes

- All forms are currently disabled (placeholders)
- UI uses a blue/indigo color scheme
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Components are structured for easy integration

## API Endpoints

### Pagination

All list endpoints support standardized cursor-based pagination with the following parameters:

- `limit` (optional): Maximum number of items to return (default: 20, max: 100)
- `cursor` (optional): Cursor for pagination (used to fetch the next page)

Response shape for all paginated endpoints:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "nextCursor"?: "string",
  "hasMore": boolean
}
```

### Available Endpoints

- `GET /api/goals`: Get paginated list of savings goals
- `POST /api/goals`: Create a new savings goal
- `GET /api/bills`: Get paginated list of bills
- `POST /api/bills`: Create a new bill
- `GET /api/remittance/history`: Get paginated list of transaction history
- `POST /api/remittance/history`: Create a new transaction

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time transaction updates
- Push notifications for bill reminders
- Charts and graphs for financial insights
- Multi-language support
- Dark mode
- Mobile app (React Native)

**API Versioning**

- **Approach (decided):** URL prefix versioning using `/api/v{n}/...` (e.g. `/api/v1/...`). This is simple to route, cache, and reason about in the frontend and server layers.
- **Current status:** The existing API surface in this repository is labeled as **v1**. To avoid breaking existing clients, the app rewrites `/api/*` to `/api/v1/*` at the Next.js layer so existing clients can continue using `/api/...` without changes.
- **Routes:** When adding new server routes, prefer placing them under `app/api/v1/` (or `pages/api/v1/` if using pages router) so they are clearly versioned. Optionally duplicate stable v1 routes under the `v1` namespace during a migration window rather than deleting the legacy route immediately.
- **How to introduce v2:** Create a new `app/api/v2/` namespace containing the new behavior. Update platform routes or API gateway rules to expose `/api/v2/...` and leave the rewrite in place so `/api/*` stays mapped to the last published stable version (v1) until you intentionally change it.

**Deprecation Policy**

- When a new major version (e.g. v2) is released, older major versions will be supported for a minimum of **6 months** before scheduled removal. During that window:
  - Maintain security fixes and critical bug fixes for the deprecated major version.
  - Announce deprecation clearly in changelogs and developer docs with migration guides.
  - Provide automated redirects or compatibility layers where feasible.

**OpenAPI / API Documentation**

- This repository contains an OpenAPI descriptor for the current v1 API at `openapi.yaml` (root). The `servers` entry points to the `/api/v1` base path. Update `openapi.yaml` as you add endpoints.

**Rate Limiting**

- All `/api/*` routes are protected by a global rate limiter using in-memory `lru-cache`.
- **Limits (per IP/session):**
  - **Auth endpoints (`/api/auth/*`)**: 10 requests per minute
  - **Write endpoints (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`)**: 50 requests per minute
  - **General read endpoints (`GET`)**: 100 requests per minute
- **Whitelisted routes**: `/api/health` is exempt from rate limiting to ensure uptime monitoring is not blocked.
- **Behavior**: When a limit is exceeded, the server responds with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code and a `Retry-After` header indicating the number of seconds until the rate limit resets. Rate limit information is also provided in the response headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`).

**Non-breaking guarantee**

- To meet the repository's backward-compatibility requirement, we keep `/api/*` behavior unchanged by rewriting it to `/api/v1/*`. This preserves compatibility for existing consumers.

If you want, I can also:

- Move or duplicate any existing API route files into an explicit `app/api/v1/` folder.
- Expand `openapi.yaml` with concrete endpoint definitions from your backend contract or tests.

API Endpoints (v1)

- `POST /api/bills` — Create bill transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Body: `{ name, amount, dueDate, recurring, frequencyDays }`
  - Validations: `amount > 0`, `dueDate` valid ISO date, when `recurring === true` then `frequencyDays > 0`.
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }` — unsigned transaction XDR ready for the frontend to sign and submit.

- `POST /api/bills/[id]/pay` — Build pay-bill transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }`

- `POST /api/bills/[id]/cancel` — Build cancel-bill transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Optional owner-only enforcement: set header `x-owner-only: 1` and `x-owner` to require the caller match the owner.
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }`

Notes:

- These endpoints return a transaction XDR composed of `manageData` operations that encode the requested action. The frontend should sign the returned XDR and submit it to Horizon (or via a backend submission endpoint) to complete the operation.
- Server builds transactions using the Horizon URL in `HORIZON_URL` and network passphrase in `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` (defaults to testnet). Set these environment variables in production to use a different network.

Insurance endpoints (v1)

- `POST /api/insurance` — Create policy transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Body: `{ name, coverageType, monthlyPremium, coverageAmount }`
  - Validations: `monthlyPremium > 0`, `coverageAmount > 0`, required `name` and `coverageType`.
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }` — unsigned transaction XDR ready for the frontend to sign and submit.

- `POST /api/insurance/[id]/pay` — Build pay-premium transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }`

- `POST /api/insurance/[id]/deactivate` — Build deactivate-policy transaction XDR
  - Request headers: `x-user` (caller public key)
  - Optional owner-only enforcement: set header `x-owner-only: 1` and `x-owner` to require the caller match the owner.
  - Response: `{ xdr: string }`

Notes:

- These endpoints return transaction XDRs composed with `manageData` operations to encode policy actions. If you prefer Soroban contract invocations, I can convert the builders to use contract calls.

## Stellar TOML discovery

RemitWise exposes wallet and anchor discovery support through the Stellar TOML standard.

- `GET /.well-known/stellar.toml`
- optional redirect via `STELLAR_TOML_REDIRECT`

The endpoint returns a valid Stellar TOML file with discovery fields such as:

- `DOCUMENTATION`
- `SIGNING_KEY`
- `TRANSFER_SERVER`
- `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT`
- `KYC_SERVER`

To configure a custom domain, set environment variables in production or host a static TOML at the domain root. If the domain is not ready yet, use `STELLAR_TOML_REDIRECT` to point wallets to a hosted TOML.

Example environment variables:

- `STELLAR_TOML_REDIRECT`
- `STELLAR_SIGNING_KEY`
